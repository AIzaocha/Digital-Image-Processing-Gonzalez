# Digital-Image-Processing-Gonzalez
Codes for most examples in the famous textbook Digital Image Processing (Gonzalez) [3rd Edition [Amazon]](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Image-Processing-Rafael-Gonzalez/dp/013168728X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1535526723&sr=8-2&keywords=digital+image+processing). I hope this can help you understand the mentioned concepts better.

## Usage
* For Julia: running the `ipynb` file in jupyter notebook and see what happens. The `ipynb` files contain results for convenience. Check [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) for installation.
* For Matlab: Just run the `m` files in your MATLAB and see what happens.
